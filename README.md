# Module1-Projects
 For my prototype 1, I chose to make a basketball game with the slingshot
 from mission demolishion and a goal from apple picker. 
 I tried to follow the basic tetrad by getting every
 asset in before getting into mechanics (code) then
 added the story element where the player tries to 
 get as many points as they can until they beat their
 high score
